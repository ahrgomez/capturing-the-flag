# Capturing the flag

This repository contains my personal collection of write-ups and walkthroughs from Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges and penetration testing labs, including platforms like Hack The Box, TryHackMe, and OSCP.

Each write-up is written in Markdown, focused on methodology, enumeration, exploitation, and privilege escalation, with clear command examples and screenshots.

The goal of this project is to document learning progress in ethical hacking, provide technical reference material, and share insights that can help others prepare for certifications or improve their offensive security skills.

Disclaimer: No active or restricted challenges are published. Only retired labs and publicly allowed content are included.
